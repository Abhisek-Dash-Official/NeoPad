# NeoPad (1st Year REPO)

![Logo](public/logo.png)

<p><strong>A nostalgic keypad mobile experience, right in your browser.</strong></p>
<p><em>A first-year project exploring complex UI logic with Next.js and Tailwind.</em></p>

</div>

> NeoPad is a single-page web application that faithfully recreates the experience of using a classic keypad mobile phone. It was built as a front-end challenge to implement complex, stateful logic in a clean UI.

> It's built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and runs entirely in your browser‚Äîno backend required.

## ‚ú® Key Features

> Classic Keypad Interface: Navigate the UI using on-screen buttons or your keyboard's arrow keys. Multi-Press T9 Logic: The core feature! Press '2' once for 'A', twice for 'B', three times for 'C', and four times for '2'.

Built-in Apps: Includes simple, working applications:

### üìû Phone: A dialer that uses the multi-press logic.

### üìù Notes: A simple note-taking app.

### üßÆ Calculator: A basic calculator.

- Nostalgic UI: Styled with Tailwind CSS to capture the feel of early 2000s mobile phones, complete with a boot screen.

- Fully Client-Side: Runs entirely in your browser. All logic is handled with React Hooks.

- üí° Core Concept: The Multi-Press Key Logic

> The main technical challenge of this project was to replicate the T9-style multi-press text input from classic phones. This logic is handled entirely on the client-side using React's useState and useEffect hooks.

### A custom hook manages:

- Tracking the last key pressed.
- A timer (setTimeout) to check if the user is pressing the same key again within a short window (e.g., 800ms).
